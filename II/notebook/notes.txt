Also, while clustering it is not advised to normalize data that are drawn from multiple distributions.

algs:
    K-means
            Num of clusters (elbow method, The silhouette coefficient) -> https://realpython.com/k-means-clustering-python/
    Fuzzy K-means
    Hierarchical clustering
    Mixture of Gaussians
While, K-means is an exclusive clustering algorithm, Fuzzy K-means is an overlapping clustering algorithm, Hierarchical clustering is obvious and lastly Mixture of Gaussians is a probabilistic clustering algorithm.
